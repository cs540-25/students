I'm Iftekharul Islam, a PhD student currently focusing on reinforcement learning applications in transportation systems. I'm interested in exploring how software engineering principles can improve machine learning systems. For this class, I still do not have a specific project topic in mind, but I'm broadly interested in studying software engineering practices in ML frameworks. I'm open to other ideas as well.
