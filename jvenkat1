Hello everyone, my name is Jorige Venkatesh, and I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee. 
My background includes experience in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and data analysis. I have research publications 
in areas like music genre classification, road lane detection, and brain tumor detection. I am passionate about applying 
machine learning and AI to solve real-world problems.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have worked as a Full Stack Developer Intern, where I gained hands-on experience 
in software development, databases, and frontend technologies. My interests lie in optimizing software performance, 
exploring scalable architectures, and leveraging data-driven insights for decision-making.

I am excited to be part of this Advanced Software Engineering class, where I hope to deepen my understanding of software 
design principles, agile methodologies, and system architecture while collaborating with peers on innovative projects.
