I am a first year M.S. student and I am interested in machine learning and game development. Although I am interested in these two topics, I am willing to use and learn new topics and new software.\
I don't have anything in particular I am expecting from this class.\

I am familiar with the following languages, tools, and frameworks:\
* C/C++
* Python
* Common Python Library
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib
    * NumPy
* Git
* HTML/CSS
* Unity
* Unreal Engine
