My name is Jashikar and I am 1st year Master's Student in Computer Science. My interests a re Web Application Development and Cyber Security.
During my under grad I took Data Science as minor and I have some idea on the machine learning models. 
So, from this course what I am expecting is if there is a possibility where we can combine both Web Development and The Machine Learning Models and create a application which might be helpful for a set of people. 
I would like to build such an application.
