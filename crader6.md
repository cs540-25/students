Intro:
My name is Cameron Rader and I'm a 2nd semester Computer Science Master's student focusing on Machine Learning and Intelligent systems. I am from Memphis, TN where I got my undergraduate degree from Christian Brothers Univeristy in Computer Science. At UTK, I am currently working in the High Performance Scientific Computing group under Victor Hazlewood as a GRA. While my work is currently in HPC, I am more interested in Applicative Machine Learning and AI and hope that this class could provide me a space to work on projects I have been thinking about as well as explore areas of the field I may have not been exposed to yet. I hope that this class will be more about experience and project building rather than busy work for grades. Obviously, ok with any format I just want to focus my time on useful projects that I can put on my resume and build up my skills.

I would really like to work on building AI agents that acomplish some kind of automation. I am fascinated with the direction AI is moving to currently with the power of Agents and want to get some hands on experience with building them. Also, it's my opinion that not enough energy is being spent on Data collection, cleaning, and manipulation. I think it could be benificial to try and come up with something unique in this area.
