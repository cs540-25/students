My name is Matthew, and I am a first year Master's student here at UTK. My experience is in Data Science and Image Analysis. I hope to learn about new software development systems and to apply research to my thesis. I am very interested in Computer Vision and remote sensing. I have particular interest in computer vision and remote sensing as it applies to Agriculture applications. I would love to perform a comparative analysis for the usage of different pipelines for collecting, aggregating, and visualizing data for remote sensing/computer vision.
