Background
I am from Johnson City, Tennessee. My main area of interest is Cloud technologies. I have a year of internship experience in Cloud Security. Lastly, I enjoy working out, the outdoors, basketball, and movies.

Interests
With research in mind, I am interested in doing a comprehensive analysis of different cloud providers laying out their obvious pros and cons as well as more nuanced differences. I would like to focus on one area in this however. For example, the effects of cloud usage on the environment or pricing compared to the efficacy of the resource. This would allow me to learn multiple cloud providers and what they offer in the process adding to my cloud engineering skillset.

What I Expect from the Class
From this class, I expect to leave with a deeper understanding on a concept that I choose to work on, providing me with more tangable experience and education on technologies used in the workforce or technologies that are projected to be used in the future.
