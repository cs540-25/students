# Myself and Interests
I am an 4th year undergrad here taking CS540 as my upper division elective for Computer Science,
and I am interested in utilizing algorithms and full stack development that enhances the interactivity
for users. I like to develop UX/UI interfaces that give users a better user-friendly experience and 
making designs that can enhance the project.

# Expectations and Goals
I expect to develop something and do research based on that by exploring different options from research.
My goal is to create an app that uses an advanced algorithm to predict behaviors of users through them 
interacting with certain contents. The algorithm will take in how the user interacts with certain features 
in the app and whether or not they like, comment, share, etc to the content. Similar to the algorithms of many
large social media companies, they use a variety of techniques in their algorithm to get users to stay in the 
app for longer. I think this is a good topic for research and a great project to work on for this class.
