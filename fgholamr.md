Who you are: First year PhD in CS with a focus in HCI

Research interests: I'm exploring different development stacks (MEAN, MERN, JAMstack), and interested in exploring the JAMstack specifically.
This is due to it's re-emergence as a popular framework, flexibility in integrated tooling and ease of scalability. My outcome/goal for the course
includes a webpage highlighting some of the key features. One research approach is to examine the tooling of the JAMstack and do a comparative analysis
across (one or many) other modern web stacks (MEAN/MERN) and the advantages and risks/challenges of each.
