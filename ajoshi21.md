Name: Advait Joshi

I am a first year masters student in Computer Science. I have previously worked on generating fused PET and CT images using Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) for super-resolution and using Deep Learning to locate oncological lesions for my undergrad final-year project. 
I have also previously worked on frontend/ backend for websites as well. My research interests include Generative Models, Web Development, Cybersecurity.
I would expect to learn about combining Machine Learning with Web Development which might be helpful for a bigger organizations.
