My name is Lilian Swann, I am a master's student in computer science. I have been an intern at ORNL for the past two years researching vehicle cybersecurity. My main focus was on securing the CAN bus from attacks, 
however, I have studied and worked on many aspects of vehicle security. 

I have very few expectations for this class, except to learn more about software engineering and become a better engineer. Similarly, I do not yet know what software engineering concepts I want 
to research, but I am excited to get started and figure this out.
