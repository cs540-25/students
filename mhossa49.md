# ABOUT ME

I am Md Alamgir Hossain, a PhD student specializing in humanoid robot learning
and reinforcement learning. My current work involves exploring reinforcement
learning to enable robots to perform complex tasks. For this course, I donâ€™t
have a specific project topic in mind yet, but I sm broadly interested in how
software engineering principles can enhance the development and scalability of
ML systems, particularly in robotics. I am open to exploring other ideas as
well.
