I took this class as a requirement as a grad student. I am looking forward to developing my skills as a engineer in this class, and am intrested in combining swe and biology. 
I would like to work with something that combines AI and biology (or medicine), I have read some studies that mention how AI was able to predict where and when breast cancer would form. 
It also showed better detection rates compared to physicians. Something I could potentially work on is the use of AI in medical images like MRIs, CT scans, x-rays.
