Hello, I am a first year Master's candidate from Memphis, Tn. My hobbies include playing soccer, watching sports, and gaming. 
My current research interests for the class are comparing different webframeworks across different languages and why each may be better or worse. 
In this course, I expect to be more well-rounded in a graduate level course within areas such as research and software. 

I would love to research the difference in frameworks and what different features included mean for certain software needs. 
Currently, I do not know which direction I would like to take for my class project ,but if I were to choose I would like to create a project based on something such as Django.
