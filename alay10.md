I am a first year Masters student. I have most of my experience is in software developement. That in includes web-design (react), game design (unity, unreal, pygame and mainly godot) and machine learning. As for my project I hope to work with either machine learning or game development. I have some idea of some project ideas for these fields and even the intersection, which was part of my research over the summer. Both of these fields are very wide so I feel like there are plenty of projects possible in these fields but I am intrested in any other fields as well.
