### About Me
I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science, having started my program in Fall 2024. 
I am interested in pursuing research in fields related to Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Causal AI.
What I hope to gain from this course is an understanding of software engineering principles and practices, as well as insights into the latest trends and advancements in the field.
