I am a first year computer science masters student with a focus in data analytics. I have done two bouts of undergrad research with the first being a dive into data analytics and machine learning with a non-profit's client data, and my second experience was more math focused research using graph theory to find minimal labelings for self-assembling DNA.
I am also currently meeting with a research group here that is mostly focused on bioinformatics under Dr. Emrich, but I have not taken on new research as of now.  

I would like to learn more about software engineering to enhance my experience as student as well as my efficiency when working on problems in my research and work in the future. I am still interested in the topics of my past research, but I am very open to new topics as well.
