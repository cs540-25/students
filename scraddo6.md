I am very interested in learning more about game development but have not had much of an opportunity to research it in an academic setting.
I don't have an extremely strict or focused idea for what I want to research, but I think it would be interesting to see how different companies 
or teams use specific tools. One example I can think of is to compare and contrast how a game like Dark Souls uses Lua against a game like Hades,
which also uses Lua but to a larger extent. 

I would also be interested in researching how engines work, and why some teams develop their own engines or use engines that are unconventional or
outdated, such as Helldivers 2 using Autodesk Stingray, which was discontinued in 2018.

The final specific topic I might be interested in looking at is how large teams collaborate using tools like version control, especially in larger teams
that still maintain freedom like those present in Valve (from what I've heard). I'd also be interested in learning about basically any other game development 
related software engineering topics that I have not already mentioned or am not aware of.
