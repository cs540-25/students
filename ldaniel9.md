I am interested in researching ways to best use machine learning tools and data visualization techniques to develop software that can be used in conjunction with existing controls systems in an industrial environment. More specifically, I would like to utilize these tools to allow system owners to optimize parameter sets with respect to desired outcomes for multi-variable processes.
