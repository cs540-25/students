I am a first year masters student from EECS department. I am primarily interested in working with intersection of Machine Learning and Software Systems. I want to develop efficient software tools leveraging machine learning and deep learning methodologies. And I hope COSC540 will help me achieve exploring those problems and provide me with some knowledge to get started on those projects.
