I am from Charlotte, NC and I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in December of 2023 with a Bachelor's in CS. I am currently pursuing my Master's in CS part-time while working full-time for CNS. 

I work as a Computer Engineer. I do a lot of things with industrial control systems (HMI/PLC) and web development. I hope to research topics related to what I work in during this class.

I hope that our research/projects helps me gain a deeper understanding of the discipline that I work in and prepares me for future projects that I will work on here at UT as well as in my job.
