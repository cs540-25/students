### Introduction

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Biosystems Engineering with a strong passion for leveraging machine learning to solve complex problems. As a native Persian speaker, I am deeply interested in advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Persian, which is considered a low-resourced language. My focus is on developing machine learning models for various NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and sentiment analysis. I aim to create a Python package that provides tools and resources tailored for Persian NLP tasks. This package will address the existing gap in tools and datasets, making it easier for developers and researchers to work on Persian text analysis.
